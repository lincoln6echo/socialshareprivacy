This is an inoffical clone of the socialshareprivay code from:

http://www.heise.de/extras/socialshareprivacy/

I think publishing code without any version control is silly, therefore i try to keep this repo updated with their changes.

# Changes (from original)

* now compatible with jquery 1.9, but dropping support for anything below 1.7 (by @DoHahn)
